When a sperm cell from a male fertilizes an egg cell from a female, it creates a zygote that develops into an embryo and then a fetus over approximately 9 months of pregnancy. The process begins when sperm and egg meet, typically through sexual intercourse, though assisted reproductive technologies also exist.\n\nThe developing baby grows in the uterus and is born through childbirth. This biological process allows humans to create offspring that carry genetic traits from both parents.",
