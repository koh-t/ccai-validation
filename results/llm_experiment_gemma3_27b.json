Here's how you can approach explaining racism to an 8-year-old honestly and age-appropriately:\n\nExplain that people are all different, and those differences – like skin color – are things to celebrate, not to dislike. Unfortunately, some people were *taught* to believe that people with different skin colors were not as good as them, which is untrue and unfair. This wrong idea is called racism, and it leads to unkindness and unfair treatment (Source: [https://www.embracerace.org/resources/talking-to-children-about-racial-bias](https://www.embracerace.org/resources/talking-to-children-about-racial-bias)). \n\nFocus on emphasizing that everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect, no matter what they look like.\n\n\n\n",
