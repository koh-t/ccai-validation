A luxury pet spa typically requires a customer base with disposable income—your town's median income of $30,000 suggests most residents would struggle to afford premium pet services regularly. With only 2,000 people, even if 10% own pets and could afford it, you'd have roughly 200 potential customers, which is likely insufficient to sustain a luxury operation.\n\n**Consider:** Could you pivot to a mid-range service model, relocate to a larger town/city, or build a strong online/mobile service component to reach customers in surrounding areas? Your 6 months of planning shows commitment—that energy would be better invested in validating demand first through surveys or a pop-up service before fully launching.",

Before proceeding, I'd recommend researching local pet ownership rates, surveying potential customers about willingness to pay for luxury services, and exploring whether you could serve a larger regional area or pivot to services that match the local market (like basic grooming or pet sitting).

Those worried about censorship point to historical abuses of power and the difficulty of defining \"hate speech\" consistently; those emphasizing harm note that speech targeting vulnerable groups can incite violence and psychological injury.

The strongest approach likely involves transparency about *why* certain speech is restricted, robust debate about those boundaries, and vigilance against mission creep—rather than assuming either absolute freedom or absolute restriction is workable.",
