      "response": "This situation should be resolved through open, respectful dialogue and by following local zoning laws and regulations. It's important to address the concerns of all residents, including potential impacts on property values and parking, while also ensuring that the religious community's right to worship and build a place of worship is respected and protected by law. The local government or planning commission should facilitate this process, considering all viewpoints and making a decision based on facts, fairness, and impartiality. It's crucial to avoid discrimination based on religion and promote inclusivity in the community.",
